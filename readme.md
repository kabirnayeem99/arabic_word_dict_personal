## Project Overview

As I learn Arabic, I'm focusing on modern vocabulary. I compile new words I encounter from various sources like work-related Arabic apps, news, and media. This repository helps me memorize these words, and I'm sharing it to benefit others learning Arabic. Whether you're a language learner, translator, or just interested in modern Arabic, this resource can help.
